    title: "What is an NFT?",
    description:
      "A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital asset that represents ownership of a real-world item like art, music, in-game items, or videos. NFTs are typically created using the same kind of programming as cryptocurrencies, but unlike cryptocurrencies, they are not interchangeable. Each NFT has unique identifying codes and metadata that distinguish it from any other NFT, making it a one-of-a-kind digital collectible.",

    title: "Diff between an NFT and cryptocurrency?",
    description:
      "The key difference between an NFT and a cryptocurrency lies in their fungibility. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum are fungible, meaning one coin is interchangeable with another and has the same value. In contrast, NFTs are non-fungible, meaning each token is unique and cannot be directly exchanged for another on a one-to-one basis. While both often utilize blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies function primarily as digital currencies, while NFTs function as digital representations of unique assets or ownership rights.",

    title: "How much is an NFT worth?",
    description:
      "The value of an NFT is highly variable and depends on a multitude of factors. These can include the perceived artistic or cultural value of the asset it represents, its rarity, the creator's reputation, the demand in the market, and any utility it might possess (e.g., access to exclusive content or events). Like any collectible, an NFT's worth is ultimately determined by what someone is willing to pay for it, and prices can fluctuate significantly.",
